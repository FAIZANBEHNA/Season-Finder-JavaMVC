<h1>Season Finder</h1> 
This Season Finder Web Application is built using Spring Boot MVC architecture with JSP for the view layer and a service component that dynamically detects the current season based on the system date. It uses LocalDateTime to determine the month and responds with a seasonal message (Summer, Rainy, or Winter), along with a representative image for enhanced user experience. I created this project to practice layered architecture, request handling using @Controller, and dynamic data rendering with JSP and Expression Language (EL). In future improvements, I plan to add support for more seasons like Autumn and Spring, enhance the UI with Bootstrap, make the application mobile-responsive, and add localization support for season names in different languages. This project is helpful for beginners learning Spring MVC structure, service-based logic, and dynamic view rendering in Java web applications.
